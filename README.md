# CodeClause-Blindness Detection using CNN Algorithm 🔍👁️

📌 **Introduction**
- This repository presents a solution to the Diabetic Retinopathy Detection task using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm.
- 🎯 Objective: Create an automated system to predict the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy in retina images.

📊 **Dataset Description**
- The dataset contains high-resolution retina images captured under various imaging conditions using different cameras and models.
- Each image is labeled with a severity score on a scale of 0 to 4, representing different stages of Diabetic Retinopathy.
- Severity Categories:
  - "NO DR" - Severity 0
  - "MILD" - Severity 1
  - "MODERATE" - Severity 2
  - "SEVERE" - Severity 3
  - "PROLIFERATIVE" - Severity 4

🚀 **Approach to Blindness Detection**
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 🧠🖥️
  - CNNs are powerful for image classification tasks, as they automatically learn features from images.
- **Platform**: Google Colab 💻
  - Google Colab provides free access to GPU resources, speeding up model development.
- **Dataset**: Kaggle 📊
  - The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's Diabetic Retinopathy Detection competition, offering diverse retina images.

🔨 **Code Explanation**
- The code implements the CNN algorithm for Blindness Detection, covering data loading, preprocessing, model definition, compilation, training, and evaluation.
- Detailed comments and explanations are provided in the code files, making it easy to understand each step.
